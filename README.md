# Installation

Or simply use the [online deployment](https://dogpixels.github.io/minibudget/minibudget.html), if available.

# Contribution and Development

Future development is currently not scheduled, as rough requirements have been met; contributions to this repository are highly welcome, however.

## Known Bugs
* Import/Export buttons don't seem to always work. Repeated usage of the desired function bypasses the issue.
* The expanses side doesn't prepend `-` to numbers automatically. Users must take care of that themselves.
* An english translation is missing.
